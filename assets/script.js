/*observations from CSS

- We'll need:

1) Display the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
    Connect Moment () to  <p id="currentDay" class="lead"></p>
2) THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours 9am - 5pm

timeblock container
timeblock form??? input??? 
save button to the right? class = ".saveBtn"

3) Code Timeblocks so that they indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

class = ".past" ".present"  ".future"

probably have to find current time and compare it to the time for each form.  

4) WHEN I click into a timeblock, THEN I can enter an event

form.

5) WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

json connect


6) WHEN I refresh the page THEN the saved events persist
